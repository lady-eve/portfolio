        <h1>What Is Climate Change?</h1>
        <h2>The Text-book Definition</h2>
        <p>Nasa defines climate change as: "a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly 
            by burning fossil fuels, which add heat-trapping gases to Earth’s atmosphere. These phenomena 
            include the increased temperature trends described by global warming, but also encompass 
            changes such as sea level rise; ice mass loss in Greenland, Antarctica, the Arctic and mountain 
            glaciers worldwide; shifts in flower/plant blooming; and extreme weather events."</p>
        <h2>What that really means</h2>
        <p>Climate change is the catch-all term for the shift in worldwide weather phenomena 
            associated with an increase in global average temperatures. 
            It's real and temperatures have been going up around the world for many decades.<br>

                Reliable temperature records began in 1850 and our world is now about one 
                degree Celcius hotter than it was in the period between 1850 and 1900 – commonly 
                referred to as the "pre-industrial" average.<br>
                
                The change is even more visible over a shorter time period – compared to average 
                temperatures between 1961 and 1990, 2017 was 0.68 degrees warmer, while 2016 was 0.8 degrees 
                warmer, thanks to an extra boost from the naturally-occurring El Niño weather system.<br>
                
                While this temperature increase is more specifically referred to as global warming, climate 
                change is the term currently favoured by science communicators, as it explicitly includes not 
                only Earth's increasing global average temperature, but also the climate effects caused by this increase.<br>
                
                Global efforts are now focussed on keeping temperatures from increasing more than two degrees above 
                that pre-industrial average, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees. That goal may still be possible if 
                the international community pulls together.</p>
                <h2>What are the effects of climate change?</h2>
                <p>
    The effects of anthropogenic – human-caused – climate change range from more frequent and severe droughts 
    to snowstorms and extreme winter weather in temperate regions as a result of warming Arctic weather fronts.<br>

    It's not only humans that are affected. Warming ocean temperatures are increasing the frequency of coral reef 
    bleaching; warmer, drier weather means that forests in some regions are no longer recovering from wildfires 
    and wildlife habitats around the world are becoming less hospitable to animals.<br>

    Climate change is having economic and socio-political effects, too. Food security is already being impacted in 
    a number of African countries and researchers are studying suggestive links between climate change and an 
    increased likelihood of military conflict.<br>

    We're already seeing the first climate refugees as people are displaced by rising sea levels, melting Arctic 
    permafrost and other extreme weather.</p>
