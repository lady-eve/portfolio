    <div class="row" style="width: 90%;">
            <p>I am a student at BGHS and make straight A's. With my 'High School Hacked' website, 
                I have created a library of answer keys and important texts to help students navigate most of the core classes
                required by all public schools. I decided to focus on school because it is my passion to learn and I wanted to
                provide a way for others to succeed in school as well. For this site I used HTML and CSS, I also used many 
                reference sites such as W3.Schools and CSS Tricks. Some challenges I encountered were those involving the look of
                my website. For example, I am a perfectionist, so when even one pixel is out of line it bothers mean. So sometimes 
                it is difficult to fix or combine elements for more cleanly and concisely written code. A couple new things I learned
                while trying to problem solve is how to add animations and different backgrounds.
